        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h3>Background and Interests</h3>
        <p>
            My name is Akshay S. Tolani, and I am currently pursuing a dual degree in Computer Science and Business Administration at Northeastern University. 
            My passion for technology started at a young age, and over the years, I have developed expertise in several programming languages, including Java, Python, and SQL. 
            During my academic journey, I’ve had the opportunity to work on numerous projects, from creating a Premier League match predictor using Python to building an interactive subletting platform using Flask and SQL.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am particularly interested in machine learning, data science, and financial technologies. As part of my work experience, I’ve interned at Hanger, Inc., 
            where I researched physical activity data for lower-limb prosthesis patients, which resulted in a published article. My most recent internship at Brown Brothers Harriman 
            allowed me to contribute to innovative solutions, including developing a real-time message tracking API and assisting clients with the migration from ISO15022 to ISO20022 standards.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of academics and work, I enjoy traveling and exploring new cultures, along with a deep interest in sports, particularly football and basketball. These interests continuously inspire me to learn, 
            grow, and apply my skills in real-world settings.
