            <p>My name is Akshay S. Tolani, and I am a current undergraduate student at Northeastern University, where I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Business Administration. With a passion for technology and finance, I’ve gained valuable experience in software development, data science, and product execution. Over the course of my studies, I’ve developed a strong technical foundation in programming languages such as Java, Python, and SQL, alongside frameworks like React and Swift.
                My recent internship at Brown Brothers Harriman allowed me to hone my skills in data solutions, where I developed JSON mapping capabilities for clients and worked on a real-time message tracking API. Prior to that, I served as a Teaching Assistant at Northeastern, helping students master Discrete Structures. I also had the opportunity to contribute to Hanger, Inc., where I analyzed data on physical activity for patients with prosthetics, leading to a publication in The Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation.
                In addition to my professional pursuits, I enjoy working on personal projects such as options price editor. My interests include machine learning, investment banking, and traveling, all of which fuel my drive to learn and innovate in new and exciting ways.
